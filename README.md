# Cattify
A little Ruby script that fetches cat facts (_tongue twister, mind..._) from [cat-fact's API](https://cat-fact.herokuapp.com/facts), and prints a single fact to the user who ran the script.

## Instructions
```
git clone https://github.com/thealiilman/cattify.git
cd cattify
ruby cattify.rb
```
